## This contains 2 functions that cache the inverse of a matrix
## 

## Function makeCacheMatrix creates a special "matrix" object 
## that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## The function cacheSolve computes the inverse of the special matrix
## returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been
## calculated and the matrix has not changes, then the cachesolve function
## should retrieve the inverse from the cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
